Abstract: 
Cold air pools are spatiotemporal phenomena that occur when cold air from higher elevations roll down the slope to accumulate in lower elevations. Behaviors like this lead to microclimate anomalies such as the city of Corvallis (Oregon) experiencing persistent cold weather even on a sunny day. We analyze multivariate temperature time-series data and associated covariates from about 160 sensors from the HJ Andrews Research Forest
(Oregon) through visualization and modeling to study this phenomenon. We develop detectors to localize cold air pools in both time and space, and carry out simulation studies to assess their performance under different microclimatic and sensor-performance conditions.
